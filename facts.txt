Potato plants produce flowers and berries that contain 100-400 botanical seeds. These can be planted to produce new tubers, which will be genetically different from the mother plant.
Potatoes can grow from sea level up to 4,700 meters above sea level; from southern Chile to Greenland. 
One hectare of potato can yield two to four times the food quantity of grain crops.

Since the early 1960s, the growth in potato production area has rapidly overtaken all other food crops in developing countries.
